Options
###############################################################################################
There are several options available to run the software. The commands, including all possible
options are listed below. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model choices: the following options influence which models are used to carry out the different
tasks within the algorithm.

- Context recommendation: via '--context_recommender', currently has the following options:
	-'Nearest_Neighbor': Uses a nearest neighbor based database search

- Context prioritization: via '--context_prioritization', currently has the following options:
	-'Probability': uses the likelihood of success for the reaction under that condition
	-'Rank': uses the rank of the reaction under that condition relative to all other outcomes

- Forward evaluation: via '--forward_scoring', currently has the following options:
	-'Template_Based': uses the original forward evaluation method enumerating all possible 
	  outcomes by applying templates and then predicting the most likely main product

- Template prioritization: via '--template_prioritization', currently has the following options:
	-'Relevance': Quantifies how relevant a given template is for the considered reactants
	-'Popularity': Ranking based on number of references in literature, independent of reactants

- Precursor prioritization: via '--precusor_prioritization', currently has the following options:
	-'Heuristic': Simple heuristic, with decreasing score as number of atoms, rings and chiral
	  centers increases
	-'SCS': Synthetic Complexity Score - learned quantity indicating how complex a molecule is. 
	 Correctly interprets molecules with a protection/deprotection group as less complex than
	 their non-protected counterparts.

- Tree scoring: via '--tree_scoring', currently has the following options:
	-'Product': uses the product of template score and forward prediction score
	-'Forward_only': uses only the forward prediction score
	-'Template_only': uses only the template score

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limits and thresholds: the following options will set limits for the different parts of the
program

- Expansion time via '--expansion_time': limit the amount of time the program spends expanding the
  retro synthetic tree. Default value is 60 seconds.
  
- Maximum search depth via '--max_depth': limit the search depth in the retro synthetic expansion.
  Default value is 3.
  
- Maximum degree of branching via '--max_branching': limit the number of branches generated in each
  layer of the retro synthetic tree. Default value is 10
  
- Maximum number of buyable trees via '--max_trees': limit the number of buyable trees the program 
  should search for. Default value is 100.

- Maximum number of templates to be applied via '--template_count': limit the number of templates
  that are appied for each expansion. Default value is 10000.
- Minimal number of templates to be considered in retro synthetic direction for non-chiral reactions
  via '--mincount_retro'. Default value is 25.
  
- Minimal number of templates to be considered in retro synthetic direction for chiral reactions via
  '--mincoun_retro_c'. Default value is 10.
 
- Minimal number of templates to be considered in synthetic direction via '--synth_mincount'. Default
  value is 50.
  
- Minimal target rank for considering a target feasible via '--rank_threshold'. Default value is 10.

- Minimal probability for considering a target feasible via '--prob_threshold'. Default value is 0.05.

- Maximum number of contexts to be proposed for each reaction via '--max_contexts'. Default value is
  10

- Maximum price per gram for a component to be considered buyable via '--max_ppg'. Default value is
  10
