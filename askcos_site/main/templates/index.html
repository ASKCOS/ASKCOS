 <p>Welcome to the ASKCOS website! Here, we have hosted a number of computational tools to assist in synthetic planning. These are listed in the sidebar to the left. Please keep in mind that this service is currently hosted locally at MIT and - as such - is not built to handle an abundance of users. Your requests may take significantly longer than expected if there are several other users on the site also performing computationally-expensive requests.</p>

<p><b>One-step Retro</b> allows you to look at suggested disconnections based solely on retrosynthetic templates. Candidate precursors are returned sorted by a heuristic scoring function that (1) <i>heavily</i> favors buyable chemicals, (2) favors smaller compounds with fewer rings and fewer chiral centers. For each suggestion, you can click on the reactant SMILES to perform another search using that new compound as a target. You can also click on the forward arrow (&rarr; ?) to open the Forward Prediction page. Clicking on the images of the suggested reactants will show the list of retrosynthetic transforms upon which the suggestion is based. You can click through to look at the details of the transform, including a list of the precedent reactions that led to that template.</p>

<p><b>Tree builder</b> allows you to run a time-limited tree expansion that will recursively apply retrosynthetic transforms in a heuristic-driven depth-first search until it reaches either (a) a buyable chemical, or (b) the maximum depth. Once the expansion time has elapsed and (ideally) candidate pathways are found and displayed, you can interact with those suggestions by hovering over the reaction nodes to evaluate the reaction using the Forward Prediction tool or to see the transform rules upon which the suggestion is based. It is also possible to "hide all" of the tree suggestions that use a certain reaction if you know that reaction to be improbable. A more extreme option is to "blacklist" that reaction, which will add it to a user-specific list of forbidden reactions. Any subsequent tree expansions you perform will exclude that reaction. The same can be done for chemicals if a particular intermediate should be avoided. You can access your blacklisted reactions or chemicals and activate/deactivate/delete them by clicking your username in the upper-right corner of the screen.</p>

<p><b>Context Recommendation: </b> allows you to use trained context recommendation models to get suggestions for reagents, catalysts, solvents, and temperature for any attempted transformation. There is both a nearest neighbor model (based on reaction fingerprints) and a neural network model that makes a direct prediction of condition. The latter is significantly faster and seemingly more accurate.


<p><b>Forward Prediction</b> allows you to use the Reaxys-trained forward predictor to anticipate the outcomes of an arbitrary chemical reaction. All species that contribute heavy atoms must be listed as <i>reactants</i>; <i>reagents</i> influence the probabilities assigned to candidate products but are not part of the template-based enumeration. While the model is trained to be condition-dependent, this is a work-in-progress. The results of a forward enumeration can be exported to a .csv for offline processing or copying/pasting into Chemdraw.</p>

<p><b>Reaction Evaluation</b> allows you to estimate the probability that a given reaction (defined by reactants and products) will succeed. The program will use a nearest-neighbor reaction condition recommendation model to find a list of possible reaction conditions. Up to ten conditions will be attempted and the most promising one reported back to you. If you already have a good idea of the reaction conditions, it may be more productive to use the Forward Prediction tool and then see if the expected product is ranked highly.</p>

<p><b>Buyable Look-up</b> is a utility to check if a certain compound is contained in our database of buyable compounds. Currently, we have approximately 175,000 chemicals (not all unique) from eMolecules, Sigma Aldrich with prices up to $100 per gram. </p>

<p><b>Drawing</b> is a utility to draw SMILES strings describing chemicals, reactions, or SMARTS strings describing templates. Note that you can also copy a SMILES string and "Paste special" in Chemdraw as well, although this does not work very well for templates.</p>
